                <p>For the last couple of decades the sport of boxing has seen a steady decline in popularity. Many fans over the years have not tuned in to boxing matches like in the past. The glory of past boxing matches like Duran, Hagler, Hearns, Leonard have been very missed. The era of Tyson, Holyfield, Lennox, Morisson are a thing of the past. The incredible records of Chavez and Robinson have not been matched. </p>
